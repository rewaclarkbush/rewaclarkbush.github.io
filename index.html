								<b>Research Interests:</b> I am curious about all topics in astrophysics, and engaged with the cultural and ethical contexts of my work. My master's thesis investigates the interstellar cloudscapes that surround the Solar System using new data from the New Horizons mission. In the realm of high-energy astrophysics, I have experience running stellar-evolution stimulations to better characterize stars that have survived an encounter with a supermassive black hole.

								Modeling all-sky galactic Lyman-α absorption due to local interstellar medium (LISM) clouds surrounding the Solar System. We predict what the Alice UV spectrograph aboard NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft should see as it reaches the edge of the heliosphere and compare models with New Horizon’s first all-sky observations.<br>

Simulating the long-term evolution of tidally disrupted stars using the stellar evolution code MESA. By comparing theoretical deviation of disrupted vs. undisturbed stars, our findings provide observational detection strategies.<br>

								<b>Teaching:</b> I was a TA for the Wesleyan University Astronomy Department for four semesters. I hosted labs, observing sessions, office hours, and graded for introductory and intermediate classes, including ASTR 105 (Exploring the Cosmos), ASTR 155 (Introduction to Astrophysics), and ASTR 211 (Observational Astronomy). Previously I worked as a Math Tutor and Writing Tutor supporting first-generation community college students at Cabrillo College.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Outreach:</b> This fall, I am leading telescope programs and giving public astronomy talks to hundreds of visitors weekly at Joshua Tree National Park through the <a href="https://www.scientistsinparks.org/">Scientists-in-Parks</a> program. From 2022-2024, I helped host weekly <a href="https://www.wesleyan.edu/astro/events/index.html">public observing nights</a> at Wesleyan's Van Vleck Observatory, including operating a Digitalis portable planetarium, the historic 1916 Alvan Clark 20" Great Refractor, and 8" and 24" reflector telescopes. I have several years of experience as a <a href="https://www.thelily.com/big-basin-was-home-to-californias-first-female-park-ranger-now-women-there-are-reeling-from-its-devastating-fire/">California State Park educator</a> designing and leading in-person and virtual natural science programming for all ages.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Equity & Ethics:</b> As a master's student, I helped re-kickstart the Wesleyan Astronomy Equity & Ethics Journal Club, hosted a reading group on decolonizing space, and organized the first (now annual) Pride Month <a href="https://inclusion.research.wesleyan.edu/2023/11/20/vvo-community-outreach/">Star-gay-zing</a> event. While at Cabrillo College, I served as Events Coordinator for the Women in Science and Engineering club, providing opportunites for gender minorities in STEM.
